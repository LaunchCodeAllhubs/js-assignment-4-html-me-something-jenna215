   <p>
      Hello! I am an 8 year old girl that loves everything Japan.
      I love watching anime and Japanese youtubers, reading and drawing manga, eating Japanese food, 
      and going to Japanese festivals - my favorite was the Cherry Blossom Festival!

   <p>
      I was supposed to go to Japan with my family in 2020, but that trip had to be cancelled...
      Now I am really hoping my family can reschedule our trip to Japan!
      After seeing so many fun and cute things from Japan in videos, I really want to explore with my family!
      I learned some Japanese from watching videos, it would be fun to talk to people in Japan!
      I also found a lot of amazing places. Here is my list of places I want to visit!
